# HTML EE Tag Parser

Just a simple script, designed to run locally - note, no input sanitising - that strips EE tags from fed HTML and generates a PHP array from the results. In theory, it could be any text that you feed it, it just searches for the contents of curly braces and generates a pre-formatted array from them.
